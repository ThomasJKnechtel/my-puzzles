# MyChessPuzzles
## Purpose
The intent of MyChessPuzzles is to give chess players an alternative method for practicing their chess tactics. Traditional tactics trainers assign puzzles based on player ratings from a large database of puzzles. By generating puzzles from a players games, users can use the MyChessPuzzles app to focus on puzzles that they face in their own games and target their weaknesses.  
  
The main purose of MyChessPuzzles however, is to challenge myself and my programming abilities. This was my first attempt at making a website (though I have since done others) and so would require me to learn many new skills. I know I learn best when I am working on something I am passionate about so what else if not chess!
